Hi, welcome to my page! I'm a final year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Data Science and minoring in Mathematics. 

My research interest broadly lies at the intersection of statistics, machine learning and healthcare. I am driven by the belief that great innovation can arise from the intersection of different disciplines. Currently, I am engaged in two exciting projects. With [Prof. Rahul Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html), I am exploring the detection of harmful distribution shifts within general internal medicine. Additionally, I am collaborating with [Prof. Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) on the development of a HoloLens-based real-time question answering assistant for presenters.
