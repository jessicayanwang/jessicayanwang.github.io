Hi, welcome to my page! I'm a final year student studying data science and mathematics at the University of Toronto.

My research interest broadly lies in developing computational and statistical methods for biomedicine. I also like to explore interdisciplinary challenges as I am intrigued by the adaptability and wide-ranging utility of these methods that span across diverse domains. 

During my undergrad, I've had the privilege of working with [Prof. Rahul Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) on detecting harmful distribution shifts and with [Prof. Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) on designing a real-time Q&A presenter assistant.
