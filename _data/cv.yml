    - title: Research Intern - Supervised by Prof. Rahul Krishnan
      institution: Vector Institute, Toronto, Canada
      year: May 2023 - Present
      description:
      - Developed binary classification models using XGBoost to predict 14-day in-hospital mortality from the GEMINI dataset with 2.2 billion+ clinical data points, assessing model performance across patient groups defined by Social Determinants of Health.
      - Analyzed how distribution shifts affected model performance, observing up to a 3.5% AUC improvement when deploying models trained on more socially-diverse subgroups to less socially-diverse subgroups.      
      - Enhanced model interpretability through SHAP analysis, identifying key features influencing predictions across diverse patient subgroups and demonstrating the need for diverse training data to improve AI model generalizability.
    
    - title: Research Intern - Supervised by Prof. Fanny Chevalier
      institution: University of Toronto Dynamic Graphics Project Lab, Toronto, Canada
      year: Jan 2022 - Present
      description:
      - Developed and deployed an augmented reality application on Microsoft HoloLens to assist presenters during Q&A sessions by analyzing audience audio input and presentation context. The system generates real-time answers and relevant content to help presenters respond more effectively on the spot.
      - Fine-tuned a BigBird-based question-answering model and DistilRoBERTa-based sentence transformer on the Huggingface Adversarial QA Dataset, achieving a 27% improvement in Exact Match score over the baseline model.
      - Streamlined the pipeline from speech recognition and presentation context processing to answer generation and relevant content extraction. Integrated the outputs using GPT-3.5, and displayed the final response on the HoloLens screen via Unity.
