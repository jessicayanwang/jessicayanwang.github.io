    - title: Research Intern
      institution: Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada
      year: May 2023 - Present
      description:
      - Leading the development of a 3D deep learning pipeline dedicated to the precise segmentation of
      neuronal somas in whole-brain light sheet fluorescence microscopy rodent data
      - Enhanced existing models by incorporating neuron density, resulting in a balanced approach that
      aligns more closely with the requirements of neuroscientists and clinicians. Achieved superior results
      compared to baseline models
      - Created a novel UNet-based architecture with integration of small image patch dependencies into
      the convolutional neural network, delivering optimal performance for processing large size microscopy
      images
    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, Canada
      year: Sept 2022 - Apr 2023
      description:
      - Successfully re-implemented a previously published few-shot learning method for predicting drug responses
      - Conducted thorough and comprehensive testing of the developed model across a wide range of datasets, 
      including immortalized cell line data, in vitro patient-derived cell cultures, and clinical trial data, 
      expanding the scope beyond the original publication
      - Bridged the gap from cell-line data to real-world clinical data, showcasing the potential of few-shot
      learning as a robust and promising tool in the medical field

    - title: Research Intern
      institution: Data Sciences Institute (DSI), Toronto, Canada
      year: May 2022 - Apr 2023
      desciption:
      - Developed a statistical model that incorporated both data and associated uncertainties, a crucial 
      consideration for the analysis of survey data concerning stars at significant distances
      - This model achieved remarkable success in the classification of blue horizontal branch stars at vast
      distances, reaching beyond half a million light-years away, utilizing photometric data from Dark Energy Survey
      - Constructed a 3-D model of the stellar halo in the Milky Way by using the predicted stars. The 
      predicted stars were also provided as a valuable catalog for the astrostatistics and astronomy communities
      for future research

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: STEM Fellowship, Toronto, Canada
      year: Dec 2021 - Dec 2022
      description:
      - Conducted research in 3D bioprinting, with emphasis on its role in advancing personalized medicine
      and exploring prevalent techniques like extrusion printing and digital light processing (DLP)
      - Discussed the multifaceted applications of bioprinted constructs, including their utilization as 
      personalized implants for regenerative medicine and as high-throughput drug development models for 
      drug discovery
      - Placed 1st in both Intraschool and National Indicium Research Conference Competition out of more
      than 80 participating teams nation-wide

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher
      institution: Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto, Canada
      year: 1909 - 1911
      description:
      - Trained a semi-supervised machine learning model for identifying major anatomical structures in musculoskeletal ultrasound images of knees
      - Achieved a 50% reduction in the number of labeled images required, resulting in a cost-effective solution for landmarking the images
