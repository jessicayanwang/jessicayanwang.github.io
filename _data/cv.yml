    - title: Research Intern @ Vector Institute, Toronto, Canada
      institution: Supervised by Prof. Rahul Krishnan
      year: May 2023 - Present
      description:
      - Analyzed the clinical database GEMINI, developed a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline to assess the effects of
        diverse distribution shifts on model performance, and evaluated the clinical utility of several modern approaches
        for detecting distribution shifts.
      - Identified statistically significant evidence demonstrating the impact of demographic shifts on model generalizability, emphasizing the crucial role of ethical considerations in model deployment.
      - Expanded the capabilities of the Detectron (distribution shift detection algorithm) by devising an innovative method
        to identify the most influential features responsible for harmful covariate shifts using large language models.
    - title: Undergraduate Researcher @ Princess Margaret Cancer Centre
      institution: Supervised by Prof. Benjamin Haibe-Kains, University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, Canada
      year: Sept 2022 - Apr 2023
      description:
      - Successfully re-implemented a previously published few-shot learning method for predicting drug responses
      - Conducted thorough and comprehensive testing of the developed model across a wide range of datasets, 
        including immortalized cell line data, in vitro patient-derived cell cultures, and clinical trial data, 
        expanding the scope beyond the original publication
      - Bridged the gap from cell-line data to real-world clinical data, showcasing the potential of few-shot
        learning as a robust and promising tool in the medical field

    - title: Research Intern @ Data Sciences Institute (DSI), Toronto, Canada
      institution: Supervised by Prof. Ting Li and Prof. Joshua Speagle
      year: May 2022 - Apr 2023
      description:
      - Developed a statistical model that incorporated both data and associated uncertainties, a crucial 
        consideration for the analysis of survey data concerning stars at significant distances
      - This model achieved remarkable success in the classification of blue horizontal branch stars at vast
        distances, reaching beyond half a million light-years away, utilizing photometric data from Dark Energy Survey
      - Constructed a 3-D model of the stellar halo in the Milky Way by using the predicted stars. The 
        predicted stars were also provided as a valuable catalog for the astrostatistics and astronomy communities
        for future research

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher @ STEM Fellowship, Toronto, Canada
      institution: Supervised by Dr. Zongjie Wang
      year: Dec 2021 - Dec 2022
      description:
      - Conducted research in 3D bioprinting, with emphasis on its role in advancing personalized medicine
        and exploring prevalent techniques like extrusion printing and digital light processing (DLP)
      - Discussed the multifaceted applications of bioprinted constructs, including their utilization as 
        personalized implants for regenerative medicine and as high-throughput drug development models for 
        drug discovery
      - Placed 1st in both Intraschool and National Indicium Research Conference Competition out of more
        than 80 participating teams nation-wide

    - title: Undergraduate Researcher in Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto, Canada
      institution: Supervised by Prof. Pascal Tyrrell
      year: Sept 2021 - Apr 2022
      description:
      - Trained a semi-supervised machine learning model for identifying major anatomical structures in musculoskeletal ultrasound images of knees
      - Achieved a 50% reduction in the number of labeled images required, resulting in a cost-effective solution for landmarking the images
