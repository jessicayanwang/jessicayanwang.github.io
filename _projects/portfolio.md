This series was based on the compositional technique - fragmentation. The key to this project was to fragment space rather than shapes. Triangulation was used to divide up space into subareas with individual functions yet interconnected through voids. The initial stage of this project was a series of study models that eventually led to a 4 X 4 inches cube. The design process avoided straight edges and 90 degree angles to result in a more free-formed cube, which was eventually developed into a folly with space for resting, dining, contemplation, cleansing, and studying!
