"Elm City Stories" is an educational game designed to enlighten players about the challenges and consequences associated with drug use. Set in the fictional Elm City, players journey through diverse narratives, encountering real-life scenarios that demand critical decision-making skills. As players progress through different chapters, they face challenges that not only test their knowledge about drugs but also hone their ability to resist peer pressure and make informed decisions. The game, with its captivating stories and lifelike scenarios, aims to educate its players about the perils of drug use in a way that's engaging and relatable.

We embarked on a mission to understand how a player's gaming experience with "Elm City Stories" correlates to their efficacy in resisting drug use. Our objective was to determine the educational effectiveness of the game and gather actionable insights for future game development.
