This project analyzes the popularity of political tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using 10,000 political tweets extracted with Twitterâ€™s API, we built a Naive Bayes classifier to predict tweet popularity, incorporating retweets, favorites, and follower counts.

### Key Achievements:
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Classified tweets into "Not Popular", "Popular", and "Very Popular" categories, achieving a **48% improvement** in precision for predicting "Very Popular" tweets compared to the baseline.
- **Popularity Score**: Engineered a custom metric combining retweets and favorites normalized by follower count to better capture tweet popularity trends.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed detailed analysis of skewed engagement metrics, handling over 1,500 outliers and visualizing insights using log transformations and correlation analysis.
